- **Active Barter Listings**: View all available barter listings in real time.
- **Add Barter Items**: Users can list their own items for barter.
- **Recommendation Model**: AI-powered recommendations based on user preferences and existing barter listings.
- **Barter Points System**: Track earned barter points, which can be later converted to currency.
- **Transaction History**: Monitor barter transactions categorized into **pending, active, and completed**.
